# Vulnerability-Management-w/-Nessus

<b> Intro to Vulnerability Management <b> 

<b> In Today's age it's important to maintain a great security posture by running a vulnerability assessment. One way to go about it is running a Vulnerability Management program. A great tool for that is Nessus which can help identify and remediate any vulnerability it finds with its scanner. In this project, we will go about how to generate the scan and identify the vulnerabilities it finds. From there we shall go about going over the report it generates. Going over the vulnerabilities and how to go about remediating them. <b> 

<b> Note: We will have the Nessus already installed on our Kali machine. We will have the other Windows/Metasploit machines already installed and configured onto our NAT network. <b>

<Our machine will be running the scan on our subnet of 192.168.10.0/24 to scan all of our devices on our network that are currently running. For now we shall be only emphasizing our vulnerable Linux machine which is at the IP shown above. <b>

We go right in the Nessus and input our device's IP address to scan. For now, we shall only put our Metasploitable machine for demo purposes. It is possible to scan more than one device at once. Depending on how big your environment is the longer it's going to take. Meanwhile, we also check if the plugins are enabled as well. <b>

<b> Viewing scan results can give a good idea of where your organization's security posture is at. It is important to know what kind of vulnerabilities to prioritize as they are being color-coded red being the most critical and should be remediated immediately. The color scheme may be customized and changed from red to purple if you'd like. The color scheme runs from high to low that being critical, high, medium,low, and last info. Prioritization of remediations should run from critical to low and dependent on your organization's risk tolerance you may choose to accept risk if it becomes too much to handle but not recommended if possible. <b> 

<b><br> Remediation Actions <b><br>

<b> We see here to actions the following scan provides for us that we may go about performing these specific actions to remediate these particular vulnerabilities by simply upgrading them to the latest firmware which I am certain these vulnerabilities have been patched. <b> 

<b><br> Generating Scan Report <b><br> 

![VirtualBox_kali attack machine_18_04_2024_18_11_48](https://github.com/CybrXylon/Vulnerability-Managment-w-Nessus-scan-on-Metasploitable/assets/150117045/04ac3aba-6c98-464c-aec6-41cfa5292755)

<b> Some reports can be exported using a customizable format. If we'd like to send it to another application to be inspected like Adobe, Excel, or Tenable.sc. The way we go about exporting a report is by clicking on the top right and clicking on Report. We must first generate a report in our preferred format. From there we shall see what type of Report we would like to export. Click Generate and from there it shall begin to download.  

<b><br> Anayzing Generated Report <b><br>

<b> As shown above, reports can be analyzed based on severity and their color schemes show from critical to low. Info vulnerabilities don't need as much attention as a critical vulnerability it could mean life or death for staying in business for your organization.

<b><br> Conclusion <b><br> 

<b>This project was quite an experience this shows it only really takes one critical vulnerability for your organization to suffer a breach. Normally a person with the title of handling the Vulnerability Management program would handle this specific process of securing the organization. It would be best practice resulting in separation of duties thus reducing risk. The information would be presented to the right team and in a perfect world they would handle the situation and go about patching the vulnerability. I had the pleasure of getting hands-on experience on how a vulnerability management tool works and why it's essential for organizations to implement a vulnerability management program to further secure their environments.<b>
